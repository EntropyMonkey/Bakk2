This is the repository used for the implementation of my bachelor thesis' practical part.

The category of my bachelor thesis is swarm intelligence. I wanted to research the influence of communication in a swarm on the swarm's success. For this I created a virtual test environment in which swarm agents had to find food. The swarms' goal was to keep as many agents fed as possible. You can find my thesis on my portfolio homepage:
